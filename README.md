# assembler-24-bit

This repository contatins assembler programs, the most fastest and most fundemtantal language in computing.

The output of assembler programs are called execution files and they're not intuitive to read.  It's best to have someone explain to you how to read an execution file (like me) rather than googeling it. But I post them here.
